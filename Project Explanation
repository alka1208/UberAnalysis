Data Collection:

The project begins with installing required libraries by upgrading pip and installing pandas using pip install --upgrade pip and pip install pandas.
The code then uses the requests library to fetch data from a URL (https://storage.googleapis.com/uber-data-engineering-project/uber_data.csv).
The fetched CSV data is read into a DataFrame df.
Data Preprocessing:

The code processes the time-related columns (tpep_pickup_datetime and tpep_dropoff_datetime) by converting them to datetime objects.
Duplicate rows are dropped using df.drop_duplicates().reset_index(drop=True).
A new column trip_id is added as an index to represent individual trips.
Creating Dimension Tables:

The code creates several dimension tables by extracting relevant columns from df:
datetime_dim: Extracts date and time dimensions (hour, day, month, year, weekday) from pickup and dropoff datetime columns.
passenger_count_dim: Extracts the passenger count dimension.
trip_distance_dim: Extracts the trip distance dimension.
rate_code_dim: Extracts the rate code dimension and maps rate codes to rate code names.
pickup_location_dim and dropoff_location_dim: Extract latitude and longitude dimensions for pickup and dropoff locations.
payment_type_dim: Extracts the payment type dimension and maps payment types to payment type names.
Creating Fact Table:

The code merges all the dimension tables with the original DataFrame df to create a fact table named fact_table. This table contains data from various dimensions as well as several relevant columns from the original dataset.
The columns included in the fact_table are:
trip_id
Dimension IDs: VendorID, datetime_id, passenger_count_id, trip_distance_id, rate_code_id, pickup_location_id, dropoff_location_id, payment_type_id
Other columns: store_and_fwd_flag, fare_amount, extra, mta_tax, tip_amount, tolls_amount, improvement_surcharge, total_amount


Project Explanation:

The project aims to organize and structure the provided Uber trip data into dimension and fact tables.
The dimension tables represent various attributes related to trips such as datetime, passenger count, trip distance, rate code, locations, and payment type.
The fact table integrates data from dimension tables and selected columns from the original dataset to create a comprehensive table for analysis.
Overall, this project demonstrates the process of creating dimension and fact tables to organize and structure data for efficient analysis and reporting in a data warehousing context.
